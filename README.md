# ScreenEdgePanGestureDemo

This is the problem:

![iOS 12 vs iOS 13](https://github.com/BigDada1/ScreenEdgePanGestureDemo/blob/master/ScreenRecording.gif?raw=true "iOS 12 vs iOS 13")

The problem only occurs in the Xcode 11 simulator without visible bezels. On real iOS 13 devices the gesture works fine. This seems to be [an intentional change](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58175406/12113606).
